# lol-hr-graph
I often play lol on an exercise bike. I wanted to see my HR overlayed over the game. Using the fitbit api and the lol API I think I can do that.

This repo depends on a file api_keys.txt that contains your fitbit oauth info and your riot dev api key. You need a fitbit app with the "personal" scope and read permissions.
